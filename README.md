[Austin Tanney](https://twitter.com/AustinTanney), [Andrew Bolster](https://twitter.com/Bolster), [Jase Bell](https://twitter.com/jasonbelldata) and Jaine Blayney set off with no plan and end up doing the same thing as everyone else these days; tearing apart the governments handling of the examinations crisis during COVID. 

Honestly, we've no idea why anyone would want to listen to this drivel, but it's probably better than doom-scrolling.

After recovering from the last recording, a house move, and a month of doomscrolling, the crew tackle more meaty topics of Data Literacy in the public and healthcare sectors, [Excel as a Database](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england), and [Chastity as a Service](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54436575). 

Oh, and we're now on Spotify somehow!
